# Customer Behaviour Analysis

## 📊 Project Overview
This project analyzes customer shopping behavior using transactional data and presents actionable insights through an interactive **Power BI dashboard**.  
The goal is to help businesses understand customer demographics, spending patterns, subscription behavior, and product performance to support data-driven decision-making.

This project demonstrates an **end-to-end data analytics workflow**, from data preparation and analysis to business-ready visualization.

## 🗂 Dataset Summary
- ~3,900 customer transaction records  
- 18 features covering:
  - Customer demographics (Age, Gender, Location)
  - Purchase details (Category, Item, Purchase Amount, Season)
  - Behavioral attributes (Subscription Status, Discounts, Review Ratings, Shipping Type)

The dataset reflects real-world retail data challenges such as missing values, mixed data types, and categorical features.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy)** – Data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering  
- **SQL (PostgreSQL)** – Business-focused analytical queries  
- **Power BI** – Interactive dashboard, KPIs, slicers, and visual storytelling  
- **DAX** – Calculated measures and dynamic KPIs  
- **GitHub** – Version control and project documentation  

---

## 🔍 Data Preparation & Analysis
- Cleaned and standardized raw transactional data  
- Handled missing review ratings using median-based imputation  
- Created derived features such as:
  - Age groups (Young Adult, Adult, Middle-aged, Senior)
  - Customer segments (New, Returning, Loyal)
- Loaded cleaned data into PostgreSQL for structured analysis  
- Answered business questions related to revenue, subscriptions, discounts, and customer behavior

## 📈 Power BI Dashboard
The interactive dashboard provides both high-level KPIs and detailed insights:

### Key Metrics
- Total number of customers  
- Average purchase amount  
- Average review rating  

### Visual Analysis
- Subscription distribution (Subscribers vs Non-Subscribers)  
- Revenue and sales by product category  
- Revenue contribution by age group  
- Customer behavior trends using interactive slicers  

The dashboard is designed with a clean layout, controlled visual interactions, and user-friendly filters for easy exploration.

## 💡 Key Insights
- Non-subscribers form the majority of customers, but their average spend is comparable to subscribers  
- Middle-aged and young adult customers contribute the highest revenue  
- Certain products rely heavily on discounts to drive sales volume  
- Express shipping users tend to have higher average purchase values  
- Loyal customers generate a significant portion of repeat revenue  

---

## 🧠 Business Recommendations
- **Subscription Growth:** Offer targeted incentives to convert non-subscribers  
- **Customer Retention:** Introduce loyalty programs for repeat buyers  
- **Pricing Strategy:** Optimize discount usage for margin-sensitive products  
- **Marketing Focus:** Target high-revenue age groups and top-performing categories  
- **Operational Strategy:** Promote express shipping for high-value customers
