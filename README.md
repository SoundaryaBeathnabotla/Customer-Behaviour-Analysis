# Customer Behaviour Analysis

## 📊 Project Overview
This project analyzes customer shopping behavior using transactional data and presents actionable insights through an interactive **Power BI dashboard**.  
The goal is to help businesses understand customer demographics, spending patterns, subscription behavior, and product performance to support data-driven decision-making.

This project demonstrates an **end-to-end data analytics workflow**, from data preparation and analysis to business-ready visualization.
